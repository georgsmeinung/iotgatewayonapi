# IoT Gateway on a Raspberry Pi

As for IoT solutions, communication architecture between transductors and the user interface (UI) is key for having a scalable and flexible platform in place. The almost exclusively used protocolo to communicate edge components with IoT Gateways is MQTT, which brokers are usually hosted on a cloud platform in order to  aggregate selected topics with messages from devices and compose dashboards updated in real-time and allows final users to interact with the deployed solutions and most likely have a control rules set in order to automate the solution. 

This PoC analyzes how the protocol stack needed for a test IoT solution could be implemented as a single IoT Gateway on a Raspberry Pi.
